# PokeSearch

PokeSearch is a simple search engine. You can search for a pokemon and return their type. You can search for a move and find out information about that move for strategic advantages. You can also search any item and return some useful information reagarding said item. All in the persuit to help pokemon trainers when they just need quick simple information.

This is a work in progress and in it's simplest form at this time. I am hoping to improve on the design of the page as well as add more features!
